I have always wanted to create a Mame arcade cabinet.  After my first prototype (see previous post), I ripped apart the shoe box prototype and built prototype 2. I used an old throw-away board from the garage and a couple of chairs.  It's not pretty, but I wanted to get some basic woodworking skills.  Excuse the mess in the basement picture. :)

I won't be doing the full enchilada arcade cabinet for a while.  Maybe it will be a fun inside project when the weather turns bad.  I'm just learning what I can from building quick and dirty prototypes.

Here's a close up of prototype 2:
